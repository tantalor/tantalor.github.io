[John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/) published a helpful [JavaScript Bookmarklet Builder](http://daringfireball.net/2007/03/javascript_bookmarklet_builder) which I used to generate my [IPA TTS bookmarklet](/blog/ipa-tts-bookmarklet).



A few users reported that [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) choked on the bookmarklet. I found that the bookmarklet builder does not produce the output that Chrome expects. I was using Chrome 15.0.874.54 beta.



For example, take this simple script.



    (function () {
      // what is 1+1?
      alert(["1+1=",(1+1)].join(''));
    })();





Gruber's script produces this bookmarklet: [Example 1](javascript:(function%20()%20{alert([%221+1=%22,(1+1)].join(%27%27));})())



> javascript:(function%20()%20{alert([%221+1=%22,(1+1)].join(%27%27));})()




If you drag this example to your bookmark bar in Chrome, it will produce this error when invoked.





> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token %




What happened? If you edit the bookmark, you will see that Chrome double-escaped the string,



> javascript:(function%2520()%2520%7Balert(%5B%25221+1=%2522,(1+1)%5D.join(%2527%2527));%7D)()




I believe this happened because the string contained some non-escaped characters such as parentheses.



Gruber points out in a footnote that his script intentionally leaves some characters unescaped for the purpose of readability.

Some sources suggest that other punctuation characters, such as brackets and semicolons, ought to be escaped, too, but I can see no practical reason to do so. If you want to be really conservative and escape just about everything, change this line:

With this change, we get this bookmarklet: [Example 2](javascript:%28function%20%28%29%20%7Balert%28%5B%221%2B1%3D%22%2C%281%2B1%29%5D.join%28%27%27%29%29%3B%7D%29%28%29)



> javascript:%28function%20%28%29%20%7Balert%28%5B%221%2B1%3D%22%2C%281%2B1%29%5D.join%28%27%27%29%29%3B%7D%29%28%29




It may not be as readable as "Example 1", but it works.
