Working on a variation of _Settlers of Catan_ called _[Vineyards of Catan](http://johntantalo.com/wiki/Vineyards_of_Catan)_.
[
Mayfair Games](http://www.mayfairgames.com) has [blank tiles](http://www.mayfairgames.com/cgi-bin/shopper.exe?preadd=action&key=MFGA8329X3&reference=/cgi-bin/shopper.exe%3Fsearch%3Daction%26keywords%3DCatan-Parts%26searchstart%3D0%26template%3DPDGTemplatesPlainSearchResult.html) and [replacement card packs](http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/3000-3299/pages/3110.htm). Current plan is to print out vineyard tiles and wine cards on sticker paper to stick on the blank tiles and replacement cards.

Progress updates to follow.
