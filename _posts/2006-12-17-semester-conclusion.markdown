I haven't written anything in a few months because there is no time during the semester to work on anything fun. This semester was good, but challenging. I took three graduate classes, each culminating in a final project. For bioinformatics, I did some [biclustering research](http://www.johntantalo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/biclustering.pdf) based on some earlier work by my thesis advisor. In digital image processing, I designed a method to [detect brake lights](http://www.johntantalo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/brakedetection.pdf) for autonomous vehicles. Lastly, Michael Jolson and I made this cool [general-purpose distributed computing system](http://www.johntantalo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/marketdispatcher.pdf) based on a market model for database systems.
